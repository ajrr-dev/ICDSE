# Introduction to Computational Design for Structural Engineers

Welcome to the repository for the course **Introduction to Computational Design for Structural Engineers**. This course provides students with the knowledge and tools to explore programming, computational geometry, and algorithmic design as applied to structural engineering challenges. The course combines theoretical foundations with practical exercises in Python (via Jupyter Notebook) and Dynamo for Revit scripting.
No programming knowledge is expected but the course is oriented towards structural engineering bachelors so some knowledge in that field is expexcted.

## Course Tools and Technologies

- **Python and Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive programming environment for learning foundational and advanced computational skills.
- **Dynamo for Revit**: Visual scripting tool to create algorithms that solve complex design challenges.

## Course Objectives

### By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. **Apply Principles of Programming**  
   - Solve simple engineering problems using programming techniques.
2. **Understand Geometric Principles**  
   - Utilize computational modeling concepts for structural applications.
3. **Plan and Execute Computational Tools**  
   - Develop simple computational tools to address typical engineering challenges.

## Course Content Overview

### 1. Applied Principles of Programming
- Basics of algorithms and programming logic.
- Working with data structures, functions, and control flow.
- Structuring programs for clarity and scalability.

### 2. Applied Principles of Computational Geometry
- Vector mathematics and linear algebra for 3D modeling.
- Planes, coordinate systems, and Boolean operations in geometry.
- Modeling points, lines, curves, surfaces, and solids.

### 3. Algorithmic-Assisted Design and Problem Solving
- Case studies in structural design and optimization.
- Project data management through computational tools.
